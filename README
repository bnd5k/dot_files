# Overview
This repo contains all of my dot files.  They're located in the home directory to take advantage of the [homesick gem](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

1. Once you have homesick installed, then pull down these files by using the following commands.

  ```homesick clone  git@github.com:bnd5k/dot_files.git.
  ```homesick symlink dot_files

Next run these two commands:
cp -rf .vim/.vim/* .vim/
rm -rf /.vim/.vim

 directory.  I'm using Tim Pope's vim-pathogen plugin (http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) which allows the easy organization of plugins under the /bundle directory.  Git submodules allow me to easily update to the latest plugins.
